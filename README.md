# DQN Algo
- processing game states with one hot encoding defenses and scaling numerical data
- flattening input and using Dense Layers
- target model for stability
- attributes rewards to every action in a Monte-Carlo way after termination
- trained against python-algo for 1k iterations with slow java engine
